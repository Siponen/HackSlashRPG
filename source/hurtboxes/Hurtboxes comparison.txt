Area.
Can't reset bodies that has entered.
If you disable an area, and activate it. Bodies that already entered the area won't be detected by signal body_entered. And there's no way to reset it,
other than to create a new instance of the hurtbox.

Repositioning the area did not help either. Probably because it's done inbetween two frames and before the next physics_process() tick.
Conclusion: Area is not suitable for re-useable hurtboxes.
